The main.c file contains all the functions needed to configure, initiliaze and recover the data from the sensor.

It also contains a trivial way of calculating the offsets, by taking the average value of a bunch of samples while the sensor is in a static position.

The main.c is to be uploaded to the board using the Intel FPGA Monitor Program.
